  SUGA is the second oldest member of BTS.
  <br>He takes good care of younger members than him. And they call me Suga Hyung and follow me well.
<br>Suga is sometimes referred to as an interest in indifference.
<br>J-Hope said no one in the group would care more about the members than Suga. According to the member, he looks cool, but <strong>he likes to be loved</strong>.
